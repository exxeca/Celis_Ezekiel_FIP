# Celis_Ezekiel_Portfolio  
This repo is my personal portfolio project for **MMED 3040 (Web Development)** and **Motion Design**, serving as part of the collaborative Level 3 IDP coursework.  

## Project Name:  
- **Professional Portfolio Website**  
This repository showcases my skills in **front-end development**, **responsive design**, **motion integration**, and **visual storytelling**.  
It is designed as the foundation for my final portfolio presentation during **Industry Night 2025**.  

## Features  
**Responsive Design** – Built mobile-first with a custom 12-column CSS grid system.  
**Mobile Navigation** – Toggle menu using pure JavaScript for small screen layouts.  
**Demo Reel Integration** – Embedded motion design work using the HTML5 `<video>` element and optional Plyr enhancement.  
**Custom Styling** – Uses handcrafted CSS and compiled SASS for scalable, clean design.  
**Accessibility-Focused** – Semantic HTML, and keyboard-friendly navigation.  
**Reusable Components** – Layouts structured through `.grid-con` and modular SASS partials.  
**Dark UI Theme** – Minimal, modern design with accent color `#FEFAE0`.  
**Cross-Course Integration** – Combines learning outcomes from Web Dev, Motion Design, and Industry Night.
